## Overview

Minimalistic C++ implementation of the scattering map introduced and defined in:

>Orchard J., Frascoli F., Rondoni., L and Mej√≠a-Monasterio C., _Particle transport in open polygonal billiards: a scattering map_. Chaos. **2024** (34), p.123158. Available at: https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0219730.

The codebase consists of a header only implementation of the map along with helper functions/classes for writing data and generating trajectories. A collection of python scripts are also available for reconstructing billiard trajectories from scattering map data, animating 'clouds' of billiard particles and visualising the coordinate space.

## Getting started

1. Clone `git clone a-figment/scattering-map-pbc` 
2. Populate directories with `mkdir -p data/{study_0,study_1} results`
3. `cd cfiles/` and attempt `make`  
4. Run the sample code `make run TARGET=main_sample ARGS="0 0"

This will write data to `data/study_0` and generate `config.json`. Running `python ../pyfiles/sample_main.py` will generate and save some visualisations of the data (trajectory plots, animations and coordinate space) in `results/`. 


Alternatively, copy the project header files `cfiles/include/*.h` into a subdirectory of choice (e.g. `project-raw/headers`) and from `project-raw/`, populate with `mkdir -p data/{study_0,study_1} results` and compile as preferred. 

## Performance
Tabulation of raw runtime (scattering map performance only) with d = 1/2.
